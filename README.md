FORTRAN code for calculating of co- and post-seismic deformation in multi-layered viscoelastic half-space based on the viscoelastic-gravitational dislocation theory.

Highlights
(1) orthonormal propagator algorithm for numerical stability
(2) finite fault model
(3) gravity effect on deformation
(4) output of complete geophysical observables (displacement, stress/strain, tilt, plate rotation, gravity and geoid changes)
